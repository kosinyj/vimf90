This is a plugin for editing fortran-90+. It gives keymapping for writing f90+ codes with ease.
The latest plugin will always be available at https://github.com/rudrab/vimf90

This is heavily under development. Kindly update, comment, suggest and check :h vimf90+List regularly
NB: Note the change in name. its now vimf90, rather then vimf90+, as github doesn't  accept + as its last letter
